            <p id="para">It is a great honour and privilege to be a part of
                A.A.M children's academy as a principal because this 
                is the school where excellency gets its synonym.
                I am commited not only to maintain the impeccable image 
                established but also to carry it forward to now heights.
                It is an era evolving with holistic education all around.
                constant innovation & improvement occured in this connection 
                but still we have to do a lot.

                The agitation of current generation indicates its anxiety
                & frustration regarding stressful present & uncertain
                future.In such a scenario, the school based education system
                requires a modified defination to balance today's need.
                Education for me doesn't mean to produce an answeringbox or 
                a cramming parrot but it meant to equip the pupils with the
                means  to find the answering for themselves within themselves.
                In fact within each student, there is a future Doctor, 
                Engineer, Teacher, Activist, Sports Person, Poet, Writer or
                thinker.It is a silent team of workers and dedicted faculty 
                who support them to visualize and channelize the resources.
                Luckily, I have that team and also a favourable managing committee.
                The entire members of the committee work hard to provide world 
                class education. The teachers are qualified in their descipline
                and dedicated for all round development of the pupils, as a 
                result of which pupils become mentally, spiritually and
                ethically strong enough to meet any challenge of life.
